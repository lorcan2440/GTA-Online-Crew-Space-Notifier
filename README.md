# GTA-Online-Crew-Space-Notifier

Get an alert when a crew spot becomes free (GTA Online / R* Social Club).

## Requirements

Install the python package dependencies using `pip install requests, Pillow, plyer`.

Keep the script running in the background - every 15 seconds the crew page will be checked and you will get a desktop notification if it has spaces (less than 1000 members).
